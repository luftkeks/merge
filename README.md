# merge
Merge Projekt for the Daimler TSS application.

The both scripts are written in Python 3.7.1 and with numpy 1.15.4.

the testMERGE.py script is simply for testing the "real" one.

The runtime of the projekt should be in order of the sorting algorithm wich is used by numpy. In the numpy documentary the worst case is given by and order of O(n\*log(n)). The runtime could also be improved by using a programming language which is closer to the hardware, such as C or Fortran.

It is assumend that the intervall array contains tupels where the smaller element comes first.
